Compute Streams with converted coordinates to cell grids
    Simplified flat earth assumption for mapping coordinates to cells in the queries. 

    You can assume that a distance of 500 meter south corresponds to a change of 
    0.004491556 degrees in the coordinate system. 

    For moving 500 meter east you can assume a change of 0.005986 degrees 
    in the coordinate system.

    The 300x300 grid is represented by cells of 500x500m.

    Cell 1.1 has center at 41.474937, -74.913585. Thus, top left corner is located at
    41.477182778 (41.474937 + 0.004491556 / 2), -74.910592 (-74.913585 + 0.005986 / 2).

    Finding the valid intervals is now easy.
    Latitude window: [41.477182778, 40.129715978] (41.477182778 - 300 * 0.004491556)
    Longitude window: [-74.910592, -73.114792] (-74.910592 + 300 * 0.005986)

    Any results outside of these windows should be ignored.

    Assuming cell 1.1 never changes coordenates, to correlate a given set of 
    coordinates to a cell of resolution N x M meters the following function 
    should be considered:

    f(latitude, longitude) = 
    {floor [(latitude - 41.477182778) / N], {floor [(longitude + -74.910592) / M]}

Query 1: Frequent Routes
    The goal of the query is to find the top 10 most frequent routes during the last 30 minutes. 
    A route is represented by a starting grid cell and an ending grid cell. 
    All routes completed within the last 30 minutes are considered for the query. 
    The output query results must be updated whenever any of the 10 most frequent 
    routes changes. The output format for the result stream is:

    pickup_datetime, dropoff_datetime, start_cell_id_1, end_cell_id_1, 
    ... 
    , start_cell_id_10, end_cell_id_10, delay

    where pickup_datetime, dropoff_datetime are the timestamps of the trip report 
    that resulted in an update of the result stream, 
    start_cell_id_X the starting cell of the Xth-most frequent route, 
    end_cell_id_X the ending cell of the Xth-most frequent route. 
    If less than 10 routes can be identified within the last 30 min, 
    then NULL is to be output for all routes that lack data.
    The attribute “delay” captures the time delay between reading the input event 
    that triggered the output and the time when the output is produced. 
    Participants must determine the delay using the current system time right 
    after reading the input and right before writing the output. 
    This attribute will be used in the evaluation of the submission.

Query 2: Profitable Areas
    The goal of this query is to identify areas that are currently most profitable 
    for taxi drivers. 
    The profitability of an area is determined by dividing the area profit 
    by the number of empty taxis in that area within the last 15 minutes. 
    The profit that originates from an area is computed by calculating the median 
    fare + tip for trips that started in the area and ended within the last 15 minutes. 
    The number of empty taxis in an area is the sum of taxis that had a drop-off 
    location in that area less than 30 minutes ago and had no following pickup yet.

    The result stream of the query must provide the 10 most profitable areas in 
    the subsequent format:

    pickup_datetime, dropoff_datetime, profitable_cell_id_1, empty_taxies_in_cell_id_1,
    median_profit_in_cell_id_1, profitability_of_cell_1,
     ... 
     , profitable_cell_id_10, empty_taxies_in_cell_id_10, median_profit_in_cell_id_10, 
     profitability_of_cell_10, delay

    with attribute names containing cell_id_1 corresponding to the most profitable cell 
    and attribute containing cell_id_10 corresponding to the 10th most profitable cell. 
    If less than 10 cell can be identified within the last 30 min, then NULL 
    is to be returned for all cells that lack data. 
    Query results must be updated whenever the 10 most profitable areas change. 
    The pickup_datetime, dropoff_datetime in the output are the timestamps of 
    the trip report that triggered the change.

    The attribute “delay” captures the time delay between reading the input event 
    that triggered the output and the time when the output is produced. 
    Participants must determine the delay using the current system time right after 
    reading the input and right before writing the output. 
    This attribute will be used in the evaluation of the submission.

    Note: We use the same numbering scheme as for query 1 but with a 
    different resolution. 
    In query two we assume a cell size of 250m X 250m, i.e., 
    the area to be considered spans from cell 1.1 to cell 600.600.
    Assuming cell 1.1 remains at the same coordinates
